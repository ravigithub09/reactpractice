# Hello World

To create the react application

### `npx create-react-app <application-name>`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Application Files and Folder Structure

 When we run the command in our terminal to create react application the following initial project structure get generated inside our project directory as shown below:

#### .gitignore

This is the standard file used by Git to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.

> A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.

#### package.json

This file defines all the settings for the React project.

![alt text](https://github.com/venubothsa/reactpractice/blob/main/packjs.png?raw=true)

- ****name**** is the name of your app.
- ****version**** is the current version.
- ****private: true**** is a failsafe setting to avoid accidentally publishing your app as a public package within the npm ecosystem.
- ****dependencies**** contains all the required node modules and versions required for the application. In the screenshot above, the react version specified is ^16.8.3. This     means that   npm will install the most recent major version matching 16.x.x.
    > It contains bydefault three Third party packages, which allow us to use react , react-dom and react-scripts in our react project.<br>
      ****react :**** This package is used to build the  UI of our application.<br>
      ****react-dom :**** This package is used by react for working with DOM.<br>
      ****react-scripts :**** It includes scripts and configuration for bable , webpack used by create react app.
- ****scripts**** specifies aliases that you can use to access some of the react-scripts commands in a more efficient manner. For example running npm test in your command line     will run react-scripts test behind the scenes.There are few scripts that you can use :
    > ****start :**** Runs the app in the development mode.It is run by the  “npm start” command.<br>
      ****build :**** Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. It is                       run by the  “npm run build” command.<br>
      ****test :**** Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.It is run by the  “npm test” command.<br>
      ****eject :**** This script is only used when you want to customize react-scripts and go on with your own.It is run by the  “npm run eject” command.<br>
      
#### package-lock.json 

This file contains the exact dependency tree installed in node_modules/.

This file is automatically generated by package.json.It makes sure that your version numbers of your dependencies are locked in so if I gave this project to anybody else anywhere around the world we make sure that the versions are correct so that it works 100 percent of the time.

It also contains a history of changes to package.json, so you can quickly look back at dependency changes.      
      
#### node_modules      

This directory contains assets that will be served directly without additional processing by webpack.

This directory contains dependencies and sub-dependencies of packages used by the current React app, as specified by package.json. If you take a look, you may be surprised by how many there are.There is no need to share this folder on github that’s why this folder is automatically added to the .gitignore.

Now when we clone project from github ,Inside the project directory  we have to run the command npm install and it will create node_modules directory inside your project directory and inside node_modules directory all the dependencies you have defined inside package.json get installed automatically.

#### public

This directory contains assets that will be served directly without additional processing by webpack.

   - ****index.html :**** provides the entry point for the web app.It consist of only one div element which we will grab in our src/index.js( javascript entry point) by its id            and inside which we will render our main App javascript component ie, App.js. When we run our app ,what we see up on the browser is App.js component.

   - ****favicon.ico (header icon) :**** It contains icon that can you see in the tab of your browser.There are online tools available like favicon generator using which we can          create our own favicon.ico by providing it icon image.

   - ****manifest.json :**** The manifest.json is a simple JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when ‘installed’ on the user’s            mobile device or desktop.Here behave means if we talk about mobile devices then how it look like in mobile’s home screen, how the app is going to launch and how its              going to look.

#### src

This is the heart of the React app. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack. You need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, otherwise Webpack won’t see them.  Browsing this folder, you see the main App JavaScript component (App.js), its associated styles (App.css), and test suite (App.test.js). index.js and its styles (index.css) provide an entry into the App and also kicks off the serviceWorker.js. This service worker takes care of caching and updating files for the end-user. It allows for offline capability and faster page loads after the initial visit.

As your React app grows,You may also create subdirectories inside src. it is common to add a components/ directory to organize components and component-related files and a views/ directory to organize React views and view-related files.

## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
